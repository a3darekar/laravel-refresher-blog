## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects.
Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# What is this?

This is me following along with the Laracasts [Laravel 5.7 from Scratch](http://laravelfromscratch.com/) series.

I guess you can consider this both **a part of my portfolio** as well as merely me **working on (re)acquiring skills both old and new**.

**Once done, I'll likely redo things ~~(visually)~~** with perhaps Bootstrap, Vuetify, Quasar components or something like that--**to demonstrate that I possess the capabilities required**.

I like to follow the make it work (1); make it work well/properly (2); make it pretty (3) principal.

# Why PHP and Laravel?

Most of my experience as of the last few years has been solely with backend web technologies in php from scratch as well [python](https://www.python.org/) web framework [django](https://github.com/django/django).

I decided **it's time to relearn php** and **brush up on php frameworks ** like Laravel, Codeigniter, CakePHP and so on.

I have previous experience with PHP from the PHP 5 days, so it seemed like as good a choice as any.
